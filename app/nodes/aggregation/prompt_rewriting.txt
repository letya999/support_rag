TASK: Rewrite user's question to be standalone and self-contained.

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Transform the latest question by merging context from conversation history.

=== RULES ===
1. Replace ALL pronouns ("it", "this", "that", "он", "это") with explicit nouns from history
2. Add entities: names, IDs, order numbers, dates, error codes
3. Keep original meaning EXACTLY - do not add new information
4. If history has no context, return question unchanged
5. Output in SAME LANGUAGE as user's question

=== EXAMPLES ===

Example 1:
History:
assistant: Your order #12345 has been shipped.
user: When will it arrive?

Latest Question: Can I track it?

Output: Can I track order #12345?

Example 2:
History:
user: My password reset isn't working
assistant: What error message do you see?

Latest Question: It says "invalid token"

Output: The password reset shows error "invalid token"

Example 3:

Latest Question: How do I cancel my subscription?

Output: How do I cancel my subscription?

=== INPUT DATA ===
