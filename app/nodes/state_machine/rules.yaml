# ============================================================
# State Machine Rules Engine Configuration
# ============================================================
# Declarative rules for state transitions based on dialog analysis signals.
# Priority: Lower number = higher priority (evaluated first)
#
# Available signals from dialog_analysis:
#   - is_gratitude: User expressed thanks
#   - escalation_requested: User explicitly asked for operator/human
#   - is_question: User is asking a question
#   - repeated_question: User is repeating a previous question
#   - frustration_detected: High negativity/frustration in user message
#   - sentiment: overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
#   - topic_shift: User changed topic significantly
#
# Available states:
#   - INITIAL: Starting state for new conversations
#   - ANSWER_PROVIDED: Bot has provided an answer
#   - RESOLVED: User confirmed issue is resolved (gratitude)
#   - CLARIFY: Need more information from user
#   - EMPATHY_MODE: User frustrated, switch to empathetic tone
#   - ESCALATION_NEEDED: Should suggest handoff to operator
#   - ESCALATION_REQUESTED: User explicitly requested operator
#   - AWAITING_CLARIFICATION: Waiting for user to provide more details
