TASK: Evaluate how well the dialog analysis integrates conversation history (multi-turn awareness).

=== INPUT ===
CONVERSATION HISTORY:
{conversation_history}

CURRENT USER MESSAGE: {question}

DIALOG ANALYSIS RESULTS:
{dialog_analysis}

=== EVALUATION CRITERIA ===

1. REFERENCE RESOLUTION (0-1):
   - Does analysis correctly handle pronouns? ("it", "this", "that problem")
   - Are references to previous topics understood?
   - Example: "Why didn't it work?" - "it" refers to previous solution

2. TOPIC CONTINUITY (0-1):
   - Does analysis track the topic across turns?
   - Are multi-turn issues recognized as same problem?
   - No topic confusion between turns

3. REPEATED DETECTION LOGIC (0-1):
   - If question is rephrased, is SIGNAL_REPEATED correctly true?
   - If question is new but related, should SIGNAL_REPEATED be false?
   - Smart handling of paraphrasing vs new question

4. SENTIMENT PROGRESSION (0-1):
   - Does sentiment classification consider history?
   - Escalating frustration tracked correctly?
   - Logical emotional trajectory

5. CROSS-TURN COHERENCE (0-1):
   - No contradictions with previous analysis?
   - Consistent signal detection across conversation?
   - Stable categorization of user intent

=== SCORING GUIDELINES ===
For each aspect, score 0.0-1.0:
- 1.0 = Perfect multi-turn awareness
- 0.7-0.9 = Good context integration
- 0.4-0.6 = Partial context understanding
- 0.1-0.3 = Poor context usage
- 0.0 = Ignores history completely

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):
{{
  "reference_resolution": 0.0-1.0,
  "topic_continuity": 0.0-1.0,
  "repeated_detection_logic": 0.0-1.0,
  "sentiment_progression": 0.0-1.0,
  "cross_turn_coherence": 0.0-1.0,
  "overall_context_integration": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}}

Overall score should be average of all 5 aspects.

CRITICAL: Output JSON only. No other text.
